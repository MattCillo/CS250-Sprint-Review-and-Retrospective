CS 250: Essential Questions

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I've learned that I can't interpret user needs by guessing. The best way is through direct engagement, like the focus group we analyzed. Once I have those needs, user stories are the perfect tool to translate them. They're effective because they force me to define who wants the feature, what they want, and—most importantly—why they want it. That "so that..." clause is my main guide; it provides the context and value behind the request, which ensures the feature I build actually solves their problem.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach now is much more iterative. The SNHU Travel project, especially the mid-project change requests, showed me how risky the "big plan up front" (waterfall) model is. My goal is to work in short, focused sprints to deliver a small, working piece of software. I plan to rely on a prioritized backlog, so I know I'm always working on the most valuable thing first. The most important process I'll incorporate is continuous feedback; by demoing my work at the end of each sprint (like a Sprint Review), I can get instant feedback and adapt, rather than waiting until the end to find out I built the wrong thing.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is about much more than just writing code. This course, by having us switch roles, really emphasized this. A good team member is a proactive communicator; they ask the Product Owner questions before they start coding (like the developer email) and they aren't afraid to report blockers in a Daily Scrum. They are also a collaborator who is willing to share knowledge, perhaps through pair programming, to break down the "knowledge silos" we read about. Finally, they are adaptable—when the requirements for the slideshow changed, a good team member welcomed the change as a way to deliver more value, rather than seeing it as a disruption.
